# Machine-learning-predicts-Red-Chris-Mime-air-quality

Project Overview
This project aims to predict the air quality of the Red Chris Mine site, focusing on key pollutants such as PM2.5, O3, NO2, CO2, SO2, CO, and PM10, and their impact on the Air Quality Index (AQI). By integrating various data sources and machine learning models, the project provides high-accuracy air quality forecasts for the mining site.

Objectives
Build an efficient ETL pipeline to extract air quality data from Tomorrow.io.
Use Python and ArcGIS to visualize pollutant distribution and trends.
Develop a predictive model using XGBoost to accurately forecast AQI.
Explore and implement additional models like Random Forest and LSTM to handle non-linear relationships and temporal patterns.
Data Source
Data is provided by Tomorrow.io based on a single latitude and longitude location.
Data includes pollutant concentrations, meteorological conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation), and other relevant indicators.
